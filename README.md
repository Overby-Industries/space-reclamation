# ♻️ Overby Industries – Space Reclamation & Debris Cleanup
🌌 Overby Industries clean sweep program, space debris removal services:

Space debris is no longer just a hazard — it’s one of the greatest bottlenecks to humanity’s growth in space.  

Overby Industries' **Space Reclamation Program** provides an **ethical, sustainable, and profitable solution** to this crisis by combining **autonomous debris removal services** with **mining reclamation technologies**.

We treat orbital debris not as trash, but as **resources waiting to be repurposed**: metals, composites, fragments, fuels — all captured, processed, and reinvested into the space economy.  

- Ethical
- Sustainable
  - Zero-Waste Space Industry

## 📖 Mission Overview
- **Clean Orbits** → Guarantee safe flight paths for satellites, stations, crewed missions, and future megastructures.  
- **Reclaim Value** → Convert debris into shielding, alloys, aggregates, or propellants — nothing wasted.  
- **Return on Investment** → Transform a global problem into a long-term recurring service business model.  

> Overby = The authority in **Space Cleanup as a Service (SCaaS)**.
We will need to use PLC ladder logic or maybe JAC programming logic to automate most of the functions of the space miners / reclaimation units.

## ⚡ Features and Business Rationale
Investors and governments are waking up: orbital debris threatens the **$1+ trillion space economy projected by 2040**.  

With **satellite density doubling every decade**, uncontrolled debris risks:  
- Collisions (Kessler Syndrome chain reactions 🔗)  
- Loss of billion-dollar assets (comms, military, weather sats)  
- Insurance premiums skyrocketing  

**Overby’s service is clear:**  

- 📉 Reduce insurance and legal liability for satellite operators.  
- 🛰 Offer subscription-style debris clearing for constellations (Starlink, OneWeb, Amazon Kuiper).  
- 📈 Governments, ESA, NASA, defense agencies → pay for orbital cleanup as an operational necessity.  
- ♻️ Captured debris = new **raw resources** sold back into in-space manufacturing economy.  

This is both **impact mission** AND **profitable business vertical**.

- [x] Open architecture
- [x] Professional collaboration standards
- [x] Modular, pluggable, sustainable design

## 🛠️ Getting our Tech & Capabilities Started
Our debris cleanup service stands on Overby’s **zero-waste engineering mandate**:

- Autonomous reclamation pods (anchoring, bagging, debris capture)
- Networked swarm coordination (Starlifter OS integration)
- In-situ refining (turn shards into shielding blocks or ingots on-orbit)
- Safe de-orbit disposal when recycling = non-viable
- Transparency via blockchain-backed debris registry (auditable removal logs)

## 🧑‍🚀 Open Knowledge Registry
We maintain this repo as an **open knowledge base** for space debris mitigation:  

- 📊 Research papers on orbital debris statistics  
- 🛰 ESA/NASA/JAXA/Korean initiatives for ADR (Active Debris Removal)  
- ⚙️ Proposed tech (harpoons, nets, tethers, drag sails, magnetic capture)  
- ♻️ Repurposing strategies — converting orbital trash into space economy resources  

PRs, issues, and references from engineers, scientists, policymakers welcome.  
This repo = Overby’s **transparent proof** that we intend to lead.

## 🌍 Global Impact + ROI
- **For humanity**: Reduce Kessler risk → ensure safe access to orbit.  
- **For investors**: New business vertical, recurring revenues.  
- **For partners**: Safe lanes for mega-constellations, lunar logistics highways, and future asteroid mining returns.  

A clean orbit = a valid return.  
Every **kg of debris removed** = 💵 insurance risk eliminated + 💰 raw resource reclaimed.
