# ♻️ Overby Industries – Space Reclamation Roadmap

**"A clean orbit is a profitable orbit."**

This roadmap outlines the phased development of Overby’s **Space Reclamation & Debris Cleanup program**.  
It serves as both a technical guide for contributors and a transparent signal to investors, governments, and regulatory bodies of our step‑by‑step plan.

---

## 🌑 Phase 1 (2025-2030) – Research & Knowledge Consolidation
**Objective:** Build the world’s most open and comprehensive registry of space debris mitigation approaches.  

- [ ] 🔍 Collect and review global research (ESA, NASA, JAXA, ISRO, etc.)  
- [ ] 📊 Build a debris statistics database (size, density, altitudes)  
- [ ] 📚 Draft policy/legal papers on liability frameworks  
- [ ] 💡 Evaluate capture tech prototypes: nets, harpoons, magnetic, tether, electrostatic  
- [ ] 🧠 Assemble Overby Advisory Forum: engineers, insurers, regulators, investors  

**Deliverables:**  
- Research repository (metadata, datasets, white papers)  
- Open report: *"State of Orbital Debris & Solutions 2026"* (public, peer‑reviewed)  

---

## 🌍 Phase 2 (2030‑2034) – Simulation & Early Prototypes
**Objective:** Move from theory → simulation → lab‑level demos.  

- [ ] 🖥 Build simulation software for swarm cleanup dynamics  
- [ ] ⚙️ Develop control logic (Starlifter OS modules + PLC subsystems) for reclamation pods  
- [ ] 🧪 Prototype capture mechanisms in lab/ground tests (robot arms, soft capture bags, magnetic anchors)  
- [ ] ♻️ Experiment with in‑lab recycling: debris → shielding blocks, alloys, aggregates  
- [ ] 📄 Engagement with insurers/regulators: define cleanup incentive programs  

**Deliverables:**  
- Simulations (repo: `space-reclamation-sim`)  
- Prototype reports documenting feasibility of Leading Capture Methods  
- Business white paper: *"Space Cleanup as a Service (SCaaS): ROI Model & Subscription Framework"*  

---

## 🛰 Phase 3 (2034‑2036) – Orbital Demonstrators
**Objective:** First in‑space demonstration missions.  

- [ ] 🚀 Launch autonomous “Reclaimer Pods” in partnership with CubeSat missions  
- [ ] ✨ Demonstrate capture of 1–5 tracked debris targets per pod  
- [ ] ♻️ Test in‑orbit processing (basic compaction into shielding bricks)  
- [ ] 📡 Provide live telemetry + transparency dashboard for governments/insurers  
- [ ] 🔗 Execute contract pilots with constellation operators (Starlink/Kuiper/OneWeb, etc.)  

**Deliverables:**  
- Public demo video/data of orbital debris removal  
- Partnership contracts with at least 1 constellation operator  
- ROI model validated in real orbital conditions  

---

## 🪐 Phase 4 (2038‑2040) – Scaled Service Deployment
**Objective:** Operate as the global **orbital debris cleanup authority**.  

- [ ] 📡 Deploy permanent cleanup fleets in congested LEO bands (600–1200km)  
- [ ] 🔄 Introduce subscription cleanup contracts for mega‑constellations  
- [ ] ♻️ In‑orbit resource recycling factories (turning debris into raw feedstock for orbital stations)  
- [ ] 🌍 Collaborate with UN/ICAO‑style body for orbital debris certification & compliance  
- [ ] 💵 Revenue at scale: insurers contract Overby to reduce claims risk  

**Deliverables:**  
- Annual debris reduction statistics (auditable & public)  
- Global adoption of “Overby Debris Certification” standard  
- First profitable, sustainable orbital debris cleanup service  

---

## 🔮 Phase 5 (2045+) – Integrated Space Economy
**Objective:** Orbital cleanup becomes core to Overby’s **closed‑loop ISRU economy**.  

- [ ] 🛰 Cleanup fleets operate seamlessly with mining pods & Starlifter II  
- [ ] 🏗 Orbital debris processing integrated into construction of habitats, depots, and megastructures  
- [ ] 🌑 Full synergy with Moon, Mars, and Titan operations  
- [ ] ♻️ Nothing wasted: orbital trash → commodities fueling the interplanetary economy

## ✅ Transparency & Accountability
- This ROADMAP is **public** and updated regularly.  
- GitHub Issues track specific technical, legal, and business tasks.  
- Governments, insurers, and operators can follow **real-time progress**.  

> **Overby Industries commits to radical transparency.**  
> This is how we earn legitimacy, reputation, and trust as the **authorities in orbital debris cleanup and space reclamation**.
